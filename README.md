Hi, my name is Famke and I am a Bioinformatics and Nano-Science master student at the University of Tuebingen. 

I am currently working on genome scale metabolic models of pathogenic bacteria. 
Most of my free time is dedicated to science-communication: I am part of the [Faktor14 magazine](https://www.faktor14magazin.de/) 
and the [StudSciCom initiative](https://www.stud-scicom.de/).

You can find more information about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/famke-b%C3%A4uerle-b2123a198/).
